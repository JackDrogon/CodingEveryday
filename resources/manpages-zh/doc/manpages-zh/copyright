The manual pages were written and translated by many different people
and improved by probably even more.  Listing all authors and
modificators for each page is not possible, but most of them are listed
in /usr/share/doc/manpages-zh/THANKS.gz.

These manual pages were put together by Chinese Man Pages Project (CMPP)
<http://cmpp.linuxforum.net>.
